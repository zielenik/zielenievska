An awesome set of tools, options and settings that expand Elementor defaults. Instead of creating new Elementor Widgets, these act like an upgrade of existing options or the self-standing panels thing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use OoohBoi Steroids? =

It depends on the widgets that you are editing. For example, if you are about to style Heading widget or Text Editor widget, HARAKIRI options will show up.
All the POOPART options can be found under "Advanced" tab, POOPART panel.
Rest assured, you won't miss them because there will always be an eye-catching icon next to the set of options (or the panel title).

= Do I need Elementor PRO with this add-on? =

No, you don't. It'll work with both free version of Elementor and Elementor PRO.
